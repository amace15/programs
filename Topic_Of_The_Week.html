			<p>
				Fossils are the remains or impression of a prehistoric organism preserved in petrified form or as a mold or cast in rock.
				Fossils are formed when an animal dies and is buried in mud or silt, and then over time as the organic composition of the animal
				decompose the bones are the only things remaining creating the fossils. Most of the fossils that we see today, excluding the fossils from the prehistoric age,
				are water creaturs because animals that die need to be covered in mud or silt, so they must die near a water source to be covered by mud.
				Land animals may die near water sources, which can cause them the ecome fossils, but most do not die near water sources. 
				This means that we may never know the full diverse land animals that used to live on Earth.
