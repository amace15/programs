				<p id="greeting">
					Dear Parents/Guardians,
				</p>
				<p>
					My name is Breanna Kosco; your student is enrolled in my first-grade class. 
					I am excited to meet you and your student and for the school year to begin!  
					I am a first-year teacher and a recent graduate of John Carroll University where I received my degree in Early Childhood Education.  
					I am currently working towards my reading endorsement at Heidelberg University as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am looking forward to an exciting year. It is my goal to provide all students with an educationally challenging, 
					yet fun, experience in my classroom. I am most looking forward to seeing the talents your student has to offer! 
					It has always been my goal to teach first-grade and I am so thrilled to share my knowledge with your student and vice-versa!
				</p>
				<p>
					This year your student will complete several fun projects and field trips. 
					These projects and field trips will not only support learning but will also encourage students to cultivate their reading and STEM abilities.  
				</p>
				<p>
					I have extremely high expectations of all my students and I know that each will be able to reach their highest potential. 
					I am asking for your help to maintain these expectations by checking in with your student to make sure that his/her work is getting done. 
					I am available to help students individually before school, during my prep periods, and after school. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Each month I will send home a classroom newsletter that will detail upcoming events and activities and any important information, 
					please keep an eye out for them at the beginning of the month. 
					I also plan for a weekly mystery reader so that family members can come to the class and read to the students.  
					I encourage and welcome your participation in the classroom as much as is convenient for you!
				</p>
				<p class="salutations">
					Sincerely,	
				</p>

					Breanna Kosco
