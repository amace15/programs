				<p >
					I feel that education is a lifelong process and the building blocks of learning are developed in the early stages of life. 
					The early years of elementary school are one of the first places that the building blocks of learning are established for 
					Early Childhood Elementary Education should provide the academic, social, and emotional basics to children.
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel that all children deserve to have the highest quality education that can be provided to them. 
					I believe that early childhood educators have one of the most important jobs that exist because they are preparing children for the world of learning. 
					An educator should be a leader, coach, counselor, and facilitator to their students. 
					All educators should be a strong example to their students, by displaying an enthusiasm for learning. 
					Early childhood educators should have great patience and the ability to adapt quickly to situations. 
					I believe a teacher should have effective class management skills and needs to use them every day in their classroom.
				</p>
				<p>
					A good early childhood educator is knowledgeable and conscious of how children develop. 
					Therefore, an important part of a good education is that teachers create developmentally appropriate class lessons that utilize the state standards. 
					I also believe that lessons need to relate to real life in order to be useful for students. 
					I believe that a good quality education comes from teachers who strive to prepare lessons that meet the needs of their lessons after they have been 
					implemented and see what worked or didn’t work. They should make improvements where they are needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					They should give students opportunities to share their thoughts and ideas throughout the day. 
					Teachers should recognize each child as an individual with unique strengths and weaknesses.
					It is the teacher’s job to help children to improve every day. I feel that students should be involved in collaborating with their teacher in making and reaching academic goals. 
					It is also important that children are given choices in doing the classroom activities. 
					The early childhood classroom should be flexible and stimulating. I feel that children in early education should have an organized, 
					clean, and safe environment to meet in. Children in early grades need to have lessons using exploratory play, guided discovery, 
					problem solving, demonstrations, and direct instruction. The curriculum should contain challenging and authentic lessons to help students to be prepared for their future endeavors. 
					I believe in Vygotsky’s concept of scaffolding and that it is an effective tool in guiding students. Teachers need to first, 
					give demonstrations and directions; second, help the student with any help; and lastly allow the child to take the initiative to do it on their own.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe that teacher’s need to reflect a love for literacy and be a highly skilled reader. 
					Early childhood classrooms should have lots of exposure to a variety of books. 
					It is essential that children get exposed to enriching texts when they are very young.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another component of education is that early childhood teachers form close partnerships with their student’s families. 
					A good education should involve collaboration between the teacher and parents. 
					This can greatly benefit the child, because then parents can help them progress on what they are learning in school.
				</p>
				<p>
					Students need to be given a variety of teaching methods in the classroom. 
					It is important for early childhood educators to reach students of all abilities and intelligence. 
					I believe that in providing a variety of learning there should be social interaction, cooperative learning, 
					hands-on experiences, and real-life applications. Students learn how to interact with others through: student to student, student to self, and student to teacher situations. 
					An early childhood teacher needs to incorporate opportunities for students to work with a variety of different children. 
					Cooperative learning will teach students how to communicate in a group and learn from others. 
					I feel this is an essential element in the classroom environment. 
					Early childhood students need to be given materials that relate to the lesson and can be manipulated because children learn by doing. 
					In conclusion, I genuinely know that a quality education is when all students are successful and make progress no matter what level they are on. 
					The greatest thing is to help improve someone’s life by teaching them how to learn effectively and to enjoy doing it.
